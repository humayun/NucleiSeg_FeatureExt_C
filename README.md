#Nuclei Morphology Framework
This framework have different function to segment nuclei and compute nuclei features including (morphology, Intensity, Co-occurrence and Run-Length texture features). This framework is used to compute nuclei features of histopathology images of Breast for PlosOne 2014 paper (Discriminate UDH and DCIS).

H&E Nuclei Segmentation and Feature Extraction Framework

This framework have different function for computing nuclei segmentation and Feature extraction like:
1- Nuclei Segmentation only
2- Nuclei Segmentation and Feature Extraction 
3- Feature Extraction only ( The segmented nuclei images should exist in the processing folder)
4- Nuclei Segmentation on Grayscale (Flouresence Images like Maximum Intensity Projection images of 3D Lightsheet Microsocpy)
5- Nuclei Feature extraction on ROI images of TCGA WSI
6- Nuclei Segmentation and Feature Extraction of ICPR MITOS Dataset 2012
7- Nuclei Feature Extraction of ICPR MITOS Dataset 2012
